    <p class="c7"><span class="c4">As the group had by now collected and arranged all of our requirements into User,
            Functional and Non-Functional Requirements we decided it was time to start thinking about turning the
            implementation into code. As the gap between code and requirements is so huge we decided to model our
            program using two architectures, abstract and concrete. Abstract is a low level of detail perspective on
            what the game&rsquo;s core fundamentals will be. &nbsp;Concrete, on the other hand, is a very detailed
            in-depth model of the entire game and reflects clearly how the game should be coded.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span>For our abstract architecture we began to brainstorm about the task and obtained valuable
            information through customer meetings. This led to entity-component diagrams, flowcharts, and component
            diagrams for the game being created. Throughout the abstract section our objective was to gain an
            understanding of how our game should play out and what as a team we would need to create and how long it
            would take. We thought about the game from a customer and user perspective when developing our ideas to try
            and keep to our user requirements.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4 c6"></span></p>
    <p class="c15"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>One example of our
            abstract architecture is our entity-component diagram, where all the entities in the game are described as a
            congregation of components. This included the boat the player will use, computer controlled enemy boats, and
            the obstacles in the game. We decided on an entity-component diagram as having the classes be boiled down to
            their base components allowed us to easily understand how the entities would act and look like in the actual
            game, allowing for easy creation of classes in the concrete architecture. </span><span class="c4">Another
            example would be our component diagram, which details how the game will store and retrieve textures for the
            sprites. It was decided that having an intermediary component would streamline the texture request system,
            and allow for easier memory management.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c4">The concrete architecture builds off our abstract models and requirements directly,
            taking the modules created in our abstract models we further broke down every part to its lowest level. This
            was done using StarUML, a piece of software used to give a visual UML representation of classes and the
            associations between them. This would give us a very structured and in-depth outline of what to code when it
            came to implementation. We split the UML models into classes based on the modules, these were: Entities,
            Screens, Utility, Scoreboard, and Game which was the main class that called and directed all others. All of
            these classes link back to one or more of our requirements.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c14"><span>The Entities model as an example, starts with the class entity in which it is defined that all
            entities will have the attributes position, sprite, height, width and velocity. It also contains functions
            to detect collisions. There are two children of Entity; Boat and Obstacle which both inherit all the
            attributes and functions. The Boat subclass contains many more attributes, relating to stats and penalties,
            and functions to do with moving the boat. As for Obstacle it just contains the damage it will do. It also
            contains a few children, Rock and TreeLog which don&#39;t move and duck which moves horizontally across the
            screen. The Entities model covers many requirements such as UR_MOVE_BOAT, UR_OBSTACLES, UR_OBSTACLES_DAMAGE,
            UR_TIRED from our user requirements and all the related functional and nonfunctional requirements seen in
            our requirements table. </span><span>Entities was also heavily influenced by entity-component diagrams that
            already had all of our entities and some basic attributes listed out. Using overlapping attributes such as
            position and Sprite we were able to easily create the UML and added many more in depth attributes and
            functions relating to each entity.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c4">We also drew up our flowcharts on StarUML in full describing all choices and
            possibilities we intended the game to have as well as all states it could reach. This allowed for simple
            logic to define where and how our user would move in a clear manner. It was however chosen to leave out
            certain details such as the controls and in leg choices the user would take as this was considered too
            intricate to create before implementation could be completed. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c4">Other methods of concrete architecture were considered however we could not find
            another chart or diagram that fit our needs for example we considered a User Case Diagram that shows the
            interaction between users and different states of the game however with only one user and a handful of
            states the diagram would have served no more purpose than a flowchart which we had already created.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span>When designing both the concrete and abstract architectures we constantly had our requirements,
            specifically the user requirements as all functional and non-functional requirements lead back to them. To
            start, Game covers a lot of the requirements as it will be the class to hold the logic of the game and what
            user actions trigger changes in state. It ties into; UR_PLAYABLE, UR_RUNNABLE, UR_CHOOSE_BOAT,
            UR_COMPLETEABLE. As for the Entities class as stated above it was designed based on; &nbsp;UR_MOVE_BOAT,
            UR_OBSTACLES, UR_OBSTACLES_DAMAGE, UR_TIRED. For example; </span><span>The AIBoat child class</span><span
            class="c4">&nbsp;of Entities, was designed to guide the computer controlled boats through the level and
            satisfies; UR_AI, UR_FAIR, UR_DIFFICULT. The last group of classes is the screens which display all
            information not in the racing part of the game such as options, selecting a boat and the winning/ losing
            screens. These were designed with; UR_PLAYABLE, UR_CHOOSE_BOAT, UR_CASUAL, UR_INSTRUCTIONS and
            UR_COMPLETEABLE, in mind. The RaceLegScreen for example, will cover very similar requirements but is based
            on the the logic of the leg not the player controlling the boat so it covers; UR_COMPLETEABLE, UR_FAIR,
            UR_AI, UR_DIFFICULT, UR_TIME_PUNISHMENT, UR_OBSTACLES, UR_OBSTACLES_DAMAGE, UR_PRACTICE. A lot of our
            classes overlap in the requirements they meet meaning there are many different ways in which we are
            approaching the same requirements. This will allow us to satisfy all the requirements in one way or another.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span>We believe that all requirements will be implemented into our game by the end of the time we
            have. Any that are not met will be noted with a reason as to why not and how we would intend to implement
            them. All UML diagrams, Flowcharts and Requirements can be found through our website.</span></p>
