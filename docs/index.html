    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>We are a team of Undergraduate students from the University of York working on a Software Engineering Project.</p>

    <h2>What is our project?</h2>
    <p>Our project is to deliver a 2D game.
        The game would be based off of the York Dragon Boat Race Challenge.
        A player would play through different legs of a boat race, playing against bots
        and avoiding obstacles in the river.
